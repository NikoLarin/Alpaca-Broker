'''
SUMMARY:
This strategy is based on my own Average Open-Close Change indicator which takes a look back period to calculate the % change from the open to close of the amt of bars in that lookback period.
A credit spread is executed when an equities price goes above/below the AOC. This strategy can be classified as a mean reversion strategy and is executed currently using only 0-DTE options.

FUTURE UPDATES:
1. Dynamic allocation: 'I want to use 5% of my portfolio for this strategy'.
2. Instead of executing at the market price, set a limit order at a more favorable fill.  
3. Bug fixes.
